<p>Chief Executive Officers of Payments Banks</p>
<p>Dear Sir/Madam,</p>
<strong>Enhancement of limit of maximum balance per customer at end of the day from ₹1
lakh to ₹2 lakh – Payments Banks (PBs)</strong>
<p>Please refer to paragraph 3 of <a href="https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=51382">Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies dated
April 7, 2021</a>on the above subject.</p>
<p>2. In terms of paragraph 4(i) of the <a href="https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=32615">'Guidelines for Licensing of Payments Banks’
(Licensing Guidelines) dated November 27, 2014'</a>PBs were restricted to hold a maximum
balance of ₹1 lakh per individual customer at the end of the day. It was also indicated in
the guidelines that after gauging the performance of the PBs, RBI may consider increasing
the maximum balance limit.</p>
<p>3. Considering the progress made by PBs in furthering financial inclusion and with the
objective of giving more flexibility to the PBs, it has been decided to enhance the limit of
maximum balance at the end of the day from ₹1 lakh to ₹2 lakh per individual customer of
PBs with immediate effect.
</p>
<p>4. The other terms and conditions of the Licensing Guidelines remain unchanged.</p>
<p>Yours faithfully</p>
<p>(Prakash Baliarsingh) <br>
Chief General Manager</p>
